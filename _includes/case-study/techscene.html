      <h2>A Community Project</h2>
      <p>
        As proud Boston natives, we’re thrilled to see the region’s
        tech scene grow. Our city’s unique approach to startups and
        deep appreciation for innovation has empowered smart
        entrepreneurs to set up roots here, and we’re honored to be
        a part of that community.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        In 2014, we were asked a simple question by a local angel
        investor and start up mentor: Would we be interested in
        developing a way to highlight all of the startups in Boston.
        Not a few. Not some. All of them.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        When considering something as fluid and diverse as the
        region’s startup world, we knew this project would require
        a build that was somehow uncomplicated but sleek, grounded
        yet adaptable. We were in.

      <h2>It’s Not the Hardest Approach; It’s the Right Approach.</h2>
      <p>
        As we began to develop the project, a few things became apparent.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        It was important the final deliverable function as a true content
        hub, able to be scaled or updated dynamically with ease.
        Additionally, this application needed to showcase the density of
        the Boston startup scene relative to its limited physical space by
        using clear visualizations, streamlined data, and an intuitive UX.
        From jobs created, to funding, to neighborhood concentrations,
        we wanted to put the scene on the map.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        So we did. Literally.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        We partnered with another local design team, and as a group,
        recognized it was paramount that the data supplied to the client
        be up-to-date and refreshed at high speeds. Also, once retrieved,
        that data needed to be displayed cleanly.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        We integrated with CrunchBase’s API, building a connection to
        deliver data and page loads in under a second. Thoughtful code meant
        fewer throughputs and a quicker, more reliable site.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        The final product came to life as the TechScene @ Boston interactive
        map – a way to visualize just how fast this scene was growing, that also reflected
        the large imprint Boston startups had on the world despite their small footprint.

      <h2>Boston Pride.</h2>
      <p>
        What started as a simple idea immediately captured the attention of
        the local scene. The site garnered recognition from startups happy
        to see the community celebrated – it was a juxtaposition of all
        the bright and innovative Boston minds.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yet Boston wasn’t the only region to take notice. Soon, other
        metropolises were adopting the idea and creating their own startup maps.
        Likewise, the phenomenon was featured in major publications such as
        Boston Business Journal. We also found ourselves at the unexpected
        center of much of the attention. Our developers are still asked to
        lecture at universities, tech meet-ups, and startup community events
        to discuss our philosophies on systems architecture, site development,
        and the relationship between form and function – all on which were
        on display with the TechScene @ Boston project.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        Most importantly, the project shined a light on Boston. In a
        city filled with smart, hard-working people, press accolades and
        national attention will always take second place to the compliments
        and congratulations we received from peers.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        It was such a simple idea. But it meant so much to those who were
        proud to call themselves part of the Boston community. Us included.
