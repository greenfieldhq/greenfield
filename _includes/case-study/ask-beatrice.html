      <h2>Must. Go. Faster.</h2>
      <p>
        Like any major city, Boston has a problem – unpredictable weather, a 
        commuter culture, and tourism make finding a place to park nearly 
        impossible. This problem isn’t just felt by city-dwellers either.
        Local businesses have a hard time reaching a critical mass of customers 
        because potential clientele can’t find a spot. Ask Beatrice 
        set out to solve this problem.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        Ask Beatrice is a widget that lives on local businesses’ sites and
        provides up-to-the-minute details on where customers may find nearby
        parking, as well as tips on how they can avoid costly parking tickets.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        While the application is great in principle, it’s only as successful
        as its load times. And Ask Beatrice’s API wasn’t functioning at an
        optimum speed, generating a lagging experience for users, which
        meant a lag in its adoption rate.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        Luckily, speed is one of our specialties. We had a simple problem
        to solve: How could we make their load times faster?

      <h2>
        From Test Drive to the Big Race.
      </h2>
  
      <p>
        We started by addressing their web based widget performance issue.
        After our analysis, it became apparent that in order to truly provide
        faster functionality, we needed to develop a new location analysis
        and caching platform specific to Ask Beatrice’s performance needs.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        So we built an API utilizing PostGIS combined with a Redis cache that
        was capable of loading complicated GPS data at faster speeds. Not
        only did this new API solve all performance issues on the desktop
        widget, it gave Ask Beatrice the opportunity to explore new ways to
        offer their product to the masses. This meant more design and
        development.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        Impressed by what was essentially our trial run, Ask Beatrice
        requested we build a user-facing mobile version of their widget.
        Yet the shift over to the phone wasn’t a Sunday drive. To guarantee
        the phone-version of their product loaded at the same speed as the
        desktop widget, we opted to build off of our newly minted map API.
        While this saved having to construct a new platform, it did mean
        building a non-native mobile web app experience. This was no easy feat.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        Because we were unable to rely on native iOS animations, we had
        to recreate complicated user interaction features with custom animations
        utilizing the Liquid-Fire library, ostensibly building a product that
        functions in the way users expect without the traditional tool kits
        most app developers have at their disposal.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        The finished product was more than Ask Beatrice could hope for – a
        mobile web experience that looked, moved, and reacted like a native
        app.

      <h2>
        Finding the Perfect Spot.
      </h2>
  
      <p>
        When it comes to building a truly beautiful user experience, we
        believe in striking a balance between elegant designs and pragmatic
        functionality.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        By drastically increasing page load performance by 5000%, we delivered
        a desktop widget that populated data quickly and integrated with a
        beautiful UX dashboard, giving all users confidence that finding a place
        to park near their business would become a non- issue.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        In addition, adapting our custom-built technology into a mobile web app,
        our attention to design details, and our ability to recreate a native-iOS
        animation experience meant Bostonians could leverage Ask Beatrice when
        they needed it most: in their cars!
