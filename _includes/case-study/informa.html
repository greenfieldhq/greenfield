      <h2>Building for the Future.</h2>
      <p>
        Like any long-lasting construction, it was important that the
        foundation of the infrastructure be strong. We needed a
        baseline system that could deliver speed, accuracy and scalability.
        We needed to start over. Entirely.
      </p>

      <p>
        We began by eliminating archaic and costly servers, and
        migrated to a modern cloud-based server solution hosted
        on Amazon Web Services without any hiccups or worries about
        security. We introduced open source software to their stack
        that helped give a more dependable and more accessible
        platform to utilize as they continued to iterate and grow.
      </p>

      <p>
        Built in 2000, their platform had performance issues and was
        becoming outdated, while its backend lacked a modern and
        efficient design with an overburdened cost structure.
      </p>

      <p>
        The challenge was simple then: We needed to re-platform their
        entire business. Well... maybe that’s not so simple.
      </p>

      <p>
        Moreover, we created a modern API tailor-fit to the new platform,
        which allowed us to develop a new web based application that
        gave the customers greater access to information.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our work didn’t stop there though. As a financial service provider,
        they literally sends millions of emails monthly. So we designed and
        developed a high “throughput” infrastructure that ensured important
        communication would no longer hit bottlenecks, regardless of how
        big their user-base grew.
      </p>

      <p>
        Finally, we worked with them to design and develop a great
        user-experience, including drastically updating their web based
        dashboard and introducing a new way for users to find relevant content.

      <h2>Simple Really Is Better.</h2>
      <p>
By removing their old system and introducing a new, custom-built platform, we were able to deliver exactly what they needed: a simplified, future-proof overhaul.
      </p>

      <p>
The move to a cloud-based solution not only gave them a scalable and safe platform, it drastically reduced server infrastructure costs and licensing by more than $250K per year. The updates also enabled their existing development team to focus on innovation and quick problem solving, rather than refactoring legacy code.
      </p>

      <p>
But meeting their expectations wasn’t the only challenge; we wanted their customers to have a better experience. Our sophisticated yet simple code meant search times increased dramatically, while our UX updates on the customer dashboards bettered ease-of-use, which should generate higher engagement rates. And in our experience, an engaged-customer leads to a profitable company.
We started from scratch and ended up on top.
