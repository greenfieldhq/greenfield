Are you looking at either building a SaaS or developing a current one? One of the things we find clients often agonize over is prioritizing which features they really need to develop, especially if they’re on a limited budget.

It’s an understandable dilemma; you want to create a product that has longevity and is a stand-out among others of its type, but early SaaS are often limited by funds. They often need to build, launch and grow very quickly to either convince investors to fund them, or to start turning a profit before funds dry up.

In terms of your development budget, it’s always a good idea to turn up with a well-thought-out plan in the first place. This saves a lot of back and forth, or starting down roads which you end up not wanting to finish.

So how are you going to decide on the best features? Here are some ways to go about it…

## Choose Your Methodology

Like anything in the SaaS/development world, there are some common methodologies that are used by SaaS to determine features. They range from simple “gut feeling” to more complicated scoring processes.

You don’t want to get so tied up in complicated methodologies that you find it difficult to reach a solution though, so here are some brief descriptions - choose the one that is the best fit for your skills and purpose!

### The Intuitive Approach

It’s fair to say that many businesses start out this way; the founder has some kind of experience where they feel something could be done better, or some solution could be developed, and they go ahead into development based on their gut feeling.

Steve Jobs was a well-known example of this approach. It involves developing at least a working prototype before seeking seeking feedback from your target customers.

Usually the intuitive approach begins with a problem statement of something you think others would be willing to pay for a solution.

A pro of this approach is that you can usually get going fairly quickly from ideation to the development of a beta product. However, a con is that you haven’t actually tested the idea on potential clients before investing the time and money into development. Not everyone is Steve Jobs: unless you score a direct hit with consumers as soon as you develop, there is often more back and forth with the developers until a desired solution is met.

### The Iterative Approach

The iterative approach involves first developing a hypothesis, then drafting a solution based on your understanding of a target customer problem. For this to work effectively, you should have done some research or collaboration with target customers prior to completing a first draft.

Your first mock up is then shared with (preferably) a group of target customers for feedback and fine-tuned based on what they tell you. You might then refine and do another round of testing/feedback.

An advantage of this approach is that you can be pretty certain that your final product is something desired by buyers, particularly if you’ve gathered enough feedback. The downside is that this can be a more time-consuming and costly approach to development. Any time you’re relying on the feedback of third parties, you run the risk of hold-ups to your process.

### The Scored Model

This is possibly the most complicated method because it involves you developing your own scoring method to identify which features will be the most impactful first. The higher the score, the greater the impact, so those are your features to start with. This works better if you’re informed by evidence from customers of what their problems and preferences are.

*[Outcome Driven Innovation](https://strategyn.com/white-papers/what-is-outcome-driven-innovation/) is one way to develop a better-scored model methodology. This is where “it enables us to address all the steps that comprise the innovation process, including market definition and selection, ideation, concept testing, and messaging. In other words, it enables us to get the entire job done.”* (Strategyn)

This method makes the scoring part a little easier because it identifies the desired outcomes for the customer and scores features based on strategic importance toward those outcomes. In this way it’s a kind of a hybrid of the scored and iterative models for development. Customer needs are clearly defined to make the decision simpler.

## Nice Theories, What Does This All Mean Practically?

Let’s assume you don’t have unlimited resources to build the most absolutely perfect software; you’re probably looking for a straightforward way to determine and prioritize your features as quickly as possible. A hybrid approach could be an efficient solution.

Here are a few steps you can take:

### \#1. Start With The Customer

What prevalent problem do your target customers have that your SaaS is aiming to resolve? Your initial idea may have come from your own experience or gut instinct, but you can find relatively inexpensive ways to validate the idea.

For example, try asking questions on Quora or in social media groups which contain your target audience. What responses do you get? Are there common themes? Be sure to ask what frustrates them about any current solutions too.

### \#2. Identify Themes

Identify the common themes of what will be the most important for your product. For each theme, generate a list of feature ideas.

### \#3. Shortlist Features

There are a number of ways you can go about this, but here are a few ideas for doing so:

What will have the biggest customer impact?
Objective of the feature as it relates to your overall objectives - e.g. to reach more clients or to provide a better service to current ones?
Is it a core feature, one that takes your product to the next level, or a “nice to have”?
What will put your brand on the map/is significantly different to current offerings?

### \#4. Shorten The Shortlist

You’ve identified your top feature ideas. If you need to shorten this list any further, you can apply some other parameters to them such as:

Cost and time to build.
Time to market
Does it give you a competitive advantage?
Complexity to build - does a framework already exist?
What is likely to have the biggest impact on your revenue?

A common place for SaaS to start is with features that will have a combination of the highest impact for the customer, a significant impact on revenue and the lowest cost to build.

## Get Agile

If you’re looking for the quickest possible turnaround on development, an agile process is usually a good move. This means that a large project is broken into smaller, independent components which can be developed separately.

“Using this strategy, you’ll save time by avoiding the many interdependencies of traditional projects and eliminate the need to support multiple platforms and versions. Instead, you can develop, package, and deploy a single version to all customers.” Salesforce

It also allows you to turn around new developments relatively quickly based on feedback you receive from customers. If you can rapidly deliver on what your customers want, this can be a significant competitive advantage.

## Keep Listening

Make sure you set up easy systems for customers to provide feedback. Are there features they really love that you’re best to leave as-is? What problems/suggestions do they have?

Give them the chance to offer feedback whenever they would like, but also proactively reach out and ask them. This way you can keep a finger on the pulse and have a good idea as to what you need to prioritize for further development.

## Final Thoughts

You’ll always find a number of different opinions on how to decide the best features for your SaaS, with many methods deriving from complex theories.

It’s up to you to decide your preference, but if you’re limited in resources to develop your SaaS, starting with those features which will give biggest bang for buck is your best bet. These could include features with high customer impact, higher impact on revenue and lower cost to build.

It is worth spending the time on analysis first so that you shorten your time and dollar spend on initial development. If you choose to adopt the agile philosophy, you are able to make improvements over time based on the regular feedback of your customers anyway.
