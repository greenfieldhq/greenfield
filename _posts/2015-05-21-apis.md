When we sat down to write this post, there were 935,345,070 websites in the
world, according to
[ Internet Live Stats](http://www.internetlivestats.com/total-number-of-websites/).
As of 2013, there were 4.4 zetabyes in the digital universe – a figure that
market intelligence firm IDC projects to increase to
[ 44 zetabytes](http://www.emc.com/leadership/digital-universe/2014iview/executive-summary.htm)
by 2020. If you think of each byte as one penny, that’s
440,000,000,000,000,000,000… a lot of pennies.

The one question this data deluge raises for our partners and clients:

### How can my business get the most out of our data?

Your business needs to generate actionable insights based on the data you can
access. For many projects, there already exist phenomenal data sources.
All we have to do is find a way to display that data in an easy-to-digest form.

So how do we get from an idea and a server farm worth of data to an incredible
tool that’s generated [great feedback](http://greenfieldhq.com/#portfolio) from
the Boston startup scene? Here’s how: APIs.

## What is an API?

An **application program interface**, or API, is a set of routines and tools –
code – that allows diverse pieces of software to speak to one another.

Put simply, an API is a digital middleman. By understanding and strictly
adhering to other applications’ rules, your app will stand on the shoulders of
giants. Done right, you’ll be able to call on data from across the internet to
offer unique and actionable insights.

## How can an API help me meet my business objectives?

APIs are powerful tools. Leveraging them in the right situations and
combinations can provide an exponential increase in your next project’s ROI.

Look at this way: In running your business or department, you constantly assess
what tasks, projects, and goals you can fulfill in house and which could be
better handled externally. It may be as simple as paying for the sensibilities
of a dedicated graphic designer or as overarching as seeking out consultants to
audit and inform your 5-year strategic product plan. In each instance, you know
that there are efficiencies to paying for specialization.

Well, in effect, an API lets you contract out elements of your software
development process. Whether accessing an existing database or streamlining
payment processing, APIs let you focus on creating value for **your** business.

## APIs in action: A real-world example

Think back through some of your recent online activity. Maybe you checked your
company’s Twitter engagement using your social media management tool of choice?
Maybe you bought movie tickets? Or maybe you got an Uber back to the office from
your last meeting?

![uber]({{ BASE_PATH }}/assets/images/apis/image_1.png)

When you open up Uber, you’re greeted with the familiar map screen. Did Uber
create its own maps service? No. They use an API to pull in the constantly
updated data generated and curated by the
[ OpenStreetMap community](https://www.openstreetmap.org/). In other words,
they leverage an API to benefit from the input of a 2 million member-plus crowd.
That decision allows them to offer their customers a better, more reliable product.

That’s one real-world example of how an API can allow your product to leverage
the data and capabilities of the many powerful apps and expansive databases that
populate our new digital landscape.

Greenfield developers took a similar approach in developing the
[ TechScene @ Boston interactive map](http://techscene.at/). When Ryan Tremaine
and others first conceived of how best to convey the explosive growth of the
Boston tech scene, their first hurdle was data.

Enter Crunchbase.

Crunchbase is a publicly-editable wiki that offers information on tech startup
activity. That means that anyone can add to or curate the data. That dynamism
means the data remains up-to-date and is as accurate as the community that
manages it.

Just as important, Crunchbase provides an API that allows their data to speak to
and interact with other applications across the web. For the development of
TechScene, this means we achieved our primary goal, highlighting the explosive
growth in the Boston-area startup scene, in the easiest-to-understand format.

Our success is measured in the number of companies that appear on the map, and
in those companies’ successes at securing new rounds of funding – many owing
their initial discovery to, literally, their appearance on the map.
