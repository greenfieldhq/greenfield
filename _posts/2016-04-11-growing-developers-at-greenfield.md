After making the leap into software development and completing [Launch Academy](https://www.launchacademy.com/) last year, I was anxious to join a company where I could work with and learn from experienced developers who were shipping high quality code. When I arrived at Greenfield, I was happy to find a team that was not only welcoming and supportive but also active in the open source community, passionate about best practices, and as excited about building awesome software as I am. Having been at Greenfield a few months now, I thought I’d share a couple of lessons I’ve learned that might be valuable to others just getting started in their software career.

### Take It One Day At a Time
When you’re just starting out, it’s easy to look around at more experienced developers and feel overwhelmed by how much there is to learn. One of the best pieces of advice that I got early on was to not stress about how I stack up against everyone else and to just focus on my own learning one day at a time. Comparing yourself to others tends to reinforce feelings of self-doubt and make your own achievements feel small. To help myself stay focused on what’s important, I’ve kept a journal of what I’m learning each day, and recently, we’ve started documenting our TIL’s in a GitHub repo as a team. It’s helpful to have a record of what I’m learning not only as a reference for future me to look back on but also as a way to pause and recognize the progress I’m making and to reflect on what I could do better tomorrow. If you spend all your energy worrying about what you don’t know, it’s easy to [downplay your accomplishments](http://larahogan.me/donuts/). But If you focus on learning something new each day, those small gains will add up to big wins over time. [All great developers were beginners](https://changelog.com/189/) at some point, and they achieved developer greatness one day a time, just like you.

### Dive In Before You Feel Ready
There’s a common misconception about learning, which assumes that learning and doing happen in two discrete steps, one after the other. Beginners often fall victim to this way of thinking because it can feel safer to focus on reading books, working through tutorials, and conceptual learning without getting one’s hands dirty. The truth, however, is that we learn by doing, and as software developers we learn to code by writing code. Becoming a better software developer is an iterative process, much like software development itself. When you execute your ideas, you discover what you really know and what you need to understand better. Each time you build something new, you learn something new. And there will always be more to learn, so the idea that you need to master a given language or technology before you begin is just not true. Instead, choose a side project to work on and troubleshoot as you go. Read the documentation. Dive into the source code. Ask for help on Slack or Stack Overflow. Start before you feel ready because if you wait until you feel ready, you may be waiting a long time.

### Share What You Know (And What You Don’t)
It’s often said that the best way to learn is to teach what you know, and I’ve found this to be very true in software development. Even if you’re new to development, there’s definitely someone out there right now who is struggling to work through something you’ve just figured out. Sharing that knowledge on Stack Overflow, on Twitter, in a blog post not only helps others but also reinforces your own understanding. I often find that trying to communicate what I’ve learned to someone else helps cement what I know, and it more often than not reveals gaps in my understanding that I can then go and fill in. That last part is key. You don’t need to wait until you’ve written perfect code before you show it to others. Showing your work in progress, asking questions, and getting feedback are all key to learning. Contributing to [open source software](https://blog.newrelic.com/2014/05/05/open-source_gettingstarted/) is an especially great way to show your work, help others, and learn while you do it. Great code does not get written in isolation. Participating in the community — giving, sharing, receiving — helps all of us get better.

I hope these reflections are helpful to others who may be just getting their careers off the ground. Software development is an exciting field to be in right now, and I feel fortunate to work with teammates who answer all of my questions and teach me new things every day.
