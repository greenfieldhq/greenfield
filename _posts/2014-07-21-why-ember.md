One of the first questions we often get from potential clients is, what is Ember.js? Typically following with, why have
you chosen to specialize in Ember.js?

Let's tackle the answers to those questions.

##What is Ember.js?##

Easy answer, it's a *framework for creating ambitious web applications*. That is the headline taken directly from the
[Ember.js homepage](http://emberjs.com), but what does that mean for the non technical audience? Let's break it down.

The tagline for Ember.js does not mention javascript, but it is a javascript framework. Before we get into what Ember.js
is, let's talk about what javascript is and why it is important. Javascript is a programming language most often used as
part of web browsers to enhance user interaction, control the browser, and manage communication with servers. Typically,
the servers would be where your database lives and where most of the data for your application would come from.
Javascript can be used on servers, as well, but in this post, we will only discuss javascript running within a browser.
My definition was generalized from [wikipedia's coverage of javascript](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript). You
can read more specifics there, if interested.

Facebook has a very rich and dynamic user interface. Facebook developers have coded a substantial amount of javascript to
deliver these dynamic user interactions within the browser. With the number of Facebook users climbing so high since it
first began at Harvard University back in 2004, expectations for interactive web applications has come to the masses.
Users are comfortable interacting with their application within a browser, whether it is to add a comment or
suggestion within a form or sharing a piece of content with a friend. All of this interaction is typically available
within one view with buttons or links that provide instant feedback upon clicking. With the widespread use of
applications such as Facebook or Twitter, users expect similar web interfaces with a high level of interaction and
speedy responses during interactive activities, such as clicking a button, and this is mostly accomplished through
javascript.

Browsing web pages from a mobile phone is also increasing at a heavy pace and, as many of you are aware, browsing the
web from your phone can also be pain if your phone's internet connection is weak. A development team well versed in
javascript has a lot of techniques at their disposal to allow for continued interaction with your application while
connection with the server has gone away, i.e. offline use. When the connection strength goes back up, the browser on
the phone can synchronize with the server, if needed.

Ember.js is a framework that improves the efficiency of developers building javascript heavy applications. It also
provides a lot for managing the browser and communication with servers. In layman's terms, developers proficient with
coding in the Ember.js framework should typically be able to build applications faster and with less bugs.

##Why have we chosen Ember.js as our framework of choice##
The major competitor to Ember.js is Angular.js. There are a lot of great posts on the internet comparing Ember.js and
Angular.js, so I will not talk much about Angular.js here, other than to say it is a viable option. We chose Ember.js
because we strongly believe in the community surrounding Ember.js. That community has built an unbelievable platform
supporting Ember.js today and will continue to serve as a huge lever helping Ember.js become an even stronger framework
in the future. We have bet our business on Ember.js and have no hesitation in utilizing Ember.js within solutions we
provide for our clients.

There are a lot of technical reasons why we like Ember.js, but that is a bit off topic for today's post. For more
technical information on Ember.js, see some of our previous and future blog posts.

Hopefully, this has helped answer why javascript is important and why we chose Ember.js as our framework of choice for
implementing javascript applications for our clients.
