Last week, [Greenfield](www.greenfieldhq.com) attended the [Fintech Sandbox](http://fintechsandbox.org/)'s Demo Day, which highlighted
some of the exciting Fintech startups which have gone through the sandbox.
What the Fintech Sandbox does is connect some phenomenal data partners
(Thomson Reuters, Factset, Tradier, Xignite), accelerator partners and
infrastructure partners (like AWS) with startups. The benefit here is that
what was once very expensive to get started (due to the cost of data access)
can now be prototyped and worked on quickly and for free.

Here are some high level themes that we came across that seemed to be
overarching related to the companies that presented:

1. Every startup that presented fundamentally implemented technology to enable better decision making by investors, individuals and other customers. [flesh this out]
2. Data feeds are still hard to wrangle and startups need better easy access
to good quality, standardized data sources. For example, some data providers
provide data in CSVs, others through proprietary formats that need to be
delivered through FTP. This non-standardization can become a major headache for
startups as they attempt to use this data.

Here's a rundown of the companies that presented:

### ForwardLane

[ForwardLane](http://forwardlane.com/home.html) offers ultra high net worth investors customized investment
advice that's. Nathan Stevenson, CEO, spoke about the $800bn shortfall for the
42mm ultra affluent investors who are affected by market volatility. They
attempt to solve this problem by programmatically generating questions and
advice to a financial advisor who wants to help them by implementing machine learning and quantitative finance in the background.

### Volos Portfolio Solutions
[Volos](http://volossoftware.com/)'s software platform lets derivative traders
and portfolio managers build a strategy for developing and analyzing complex
derivative trades. This was an impressive looking piece of software. If you were
a trader or portfolio managers, you could enter in your criteria like the
options you were interested in along with a general thesis and risk objectives
and Volos' software recommends a series of options strategies that fit your
objectives. From the demo, the software looks like a single page app along with
some scenario analysis tools. It provides for a massive competitive advantage within this asset class.

### Cognism

[Cognism](http://www.cognism.com) improves lead generation time for financial
professionals.

Cognism is a web-based productivity suite for financial professionals that dissects financial research and news into unique knowledge blocks. It kind of looks like
a Trello or Kanban board and uses that UI to create a sales pipeline for users.
In particular, its intelligence lays in the ability to create "triggers" on
personnel changes at companies to create leads. For example, a user can set up
a trigger like "please look up everyone in CA that has changed jobs" and when
this trigger gets hit, the user is notified of what caused that trigger, thereby
generating a lead. Their current client roster ranges from the Financial Times
to a wealth manager in CA, engineering firms in Switzerland and asset managers
in London. Their tagline is "We push opportunities to your people."

### Nutonian

[Nutonian](http://nutonian.com)'s main product Eureqa stems from a Cornell
University AI Lab. It helps investment professionals analyze data by providing
the best models they can use based on billions of datapoints. According to them,
there are hundreds of thousands of "Data scientist" job openings out there,
which indicates that there is a shortage of expertise out there to help with
good analytics. This is the general process of their product: (1) User either
uploads data or connects to a data provider (like Factset); (2) The data gets
analyzed against thousands of economic indicators; and (3) A series of models
and their historical accuracy is sent back to the user, from which they can
decide which are the best to use.

### Kyper

[Kyper](https://www.kyper.com/)'s marketplace matches data providers with
developers. Similar to [Quandl](https://www.quandl.com/), it matches developers
with much needed datasets that allow them to quickly prototype and develop
ideas. They are trying to solve the problem of imposed technologies by data
providers, like Java, .NET, C#, various communication protocols, formats like
csv, xml, or xls. Their marketplace allows the developer to gain access to data based on their needs rather than the imposed restrictions of the data providers.

### EverSafe
[EverSafe](https://www.eversafe.com/index.html) provides the elderly and their family members protection from
fraud. The elderly have significant risks associated with financial
exploitation. EverSafe's technology tries to get ahead of these fraudulent
activities by analyzing financial data and flagging any suspicious activity.
For example, there are more than sixty red flags for older populations and
EverSafe's technology scans its users' financial accounts looking for these red
flags. Family members get alerted when any suspicious activity shows up.
