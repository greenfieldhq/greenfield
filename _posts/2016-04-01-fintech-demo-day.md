Last week, [Greenfield](http://www.greenfieldhq.com) attended the [FinTech Sandbox](http://FinTechsandbox.org/)'s Demo Day, which highlighted
some of the exciting FinTech startups which have gone through the program.
The FinTech Sandbox connects some phenomenal data partners (Thomson Reuters,
Factset, Tradier, Xignite, and others), accelerator partners and infrastructure
partners (like AWS) with startups. The benefit here is that what was once very
expensive to get started (due to the cost of data access) can now be prototyped
and worked on quickly and for free.

A few high level themes arose from the event:

### Non-standardized data feeds are a headache

Data feeds are still hard to wrangle and startups need better, easier access
to good quality, standardized data sources. For example, some data providers
provide data in CSVs, some in XML, and others through proprietary formats that
need to be delivered through FTP. This non-standardization can become a major
headache for startups as they attempt to use this data.

### Technology is used for better decision making

Each presenting startup implements technology to enable better decision making
by its end customers. Some offer tools that allow users to have as little input
as necessary to make a decision while others require significant input. However,
they all fundamentally require inputs that get parsed, calculated and analyzed,
which then is fed back to the user in a nice UI with some clarity to help the
user make a decision.

### Application design & flow incredibly important in FinTech

Data is meaningless on its own, but once integrated with a solidly designed
application that keeps the end user and her requirements in mind, it can reveal
important insights and discoveries. The strongest application developers
fundamentally value design, and the strongest applications add business value
through thoughtful and deliberate design. The startups that presented clearly
recognize this, thereby providing meaningful revelations to their end customers.

Here's a rundown of the companies that presented:

### Cognism

[Cognism](http://www.cognism.com) improves lead generation time for financial
professionals. Its UI, which resembles a Trello or Kanban board, creates a
sales pipeline for its users. In particular, its intelligence lays in the
ability to create "triggers" on personnel changes at companies to create leads.
For example, a user can set up a trigger like "please look up everyone in CA
that has changed jobs" and when this trigger gets hit, the user is notified of
what caused that trigger, thereby generating a lead. Their current client
roster ranges from the Financial Times to a wealth manager in CA, engineering
firms in Switzerland and asset managers in London. Their tagline is "We push
opportunities to your people."

### EverSafe

[EverSafe](https://www.eversafe.com/index.html) provides the elderly and their family members protection from
fraud. The elderly face significant risks associated with financial
exploitation. EverSafe's technology gets ahead of these fraudulent activities
by analyzing end-user financial data and flagging any suspicious activity.
For example, there are more than sixty red flags for older populations and
EverSafe's technology scans its users' financial accounts looking for these red
flags. Family members get alerted as suspicious activity arises.

### ForwardLane

[ForwardLane](http://forwardlane.com/home.html) offers ultra high net worth investors customized investment
advice. They spoke about the $800bn shortfall for the 42mm ultra affluent
investors who are affected by market volatility. They attempt to solve this
problem by programmatically generating questions and advice for their users
through techniques in quantitative finance and machine learning.

### Kyper

[Kyper](https://www.kyper.com/)'s marketplace matches data providers with
developers. Similar to [Quandl](https://www.quandl.com/), it matches developers
with much needed datasets that allow them to quickly prototype and develop
ideas. They are trying to solve the problem of imposed technologies by data
providers, like Java, .NET, C#, various communication protocols, formats like
csv, xml, or xls. Their marketplace allows the developer to gain access to data
based on their needs rather than the imposed restrictions of the data providers.

### Nutonian

[Nutonian](http://nutonian.com)'s main product Eureqa stems from a Cornell
University AI Lab. It helps investment professionals analyze data by providing
the best models they can use based on billions of datapoints. According to them,
there are hundreds of thousands of "Data scientist" job openings out there,
which indicates that there is a shortage of expertise out there to help with
good analytics. This is the general process of their product: (1) User either
uploads data or connects to a data provider (like Factset); (2) The data gets
analyzed against thousands of economic indicators; and (3) A series of models
and their historical accuracy is sent back to the user, from which they can
decide which are the best to use.

### Open Invest Co.

[Open Invest](https://openinvest.co/) gives its users the ability to choose
investment strategies based on both financial return and social good. Their
argument is that Millenials invest based on their own values, and that
investing with an eye for social good can be just as profitable as not. They
offer a clean, crisp dashboard that lets users pick industries they are not
interested in (like Tobacco, for example), and their software returns possible
investment strategies based on their inputs. The system builds on itself as it
gains more insight in what types of companies its users don't want to invest in.

### Trigger

[Trigger](http://www.triggerfinance.com)'s users can create a simple `IF x THEN y` type of statement
which generates a "trigger," from which the user can open or close orders. They
effectively watch the market and put trades into place that get generated by a
user's triggers. These flow control statements can be created using pricing data
from Xignite, news data from Benzinga or even broader economic reports. They
offer the user real time push notifications of when triggers are fired and
engage in social networking around these triggers so users can see how other
users are trading.

### Volos Portfolio Solutions

[Volos](http://volossoftware.com/)'s software platform lets derivative traders
and portfolio managers build a strategy for developing and analyzing complex
derivative trades. This was an impressive looking piece of software. If you were
a trader or portfolio managers, you could enter in your criteria like the
options you were interested in along with a general thesis and risk objectives
and Volos' software recommends a series of options strategies that fit your
objectives. From the demo, the software looks like a single page app along with
some scenario analysis tools. It provides for a massive competitive advantage
within this asset class.

### Ending Thoughts

FinTech is an exciting space, and the startups that presented each have specific
problems they're trying to solve. Between enabling machines to help us humans
make better decisions to curating better data for better app development, they
are poised to handle traditional problems in new and unique ways.
