# Comment Box

Fridays here at Greenfield are personal improvement days. We spend the day
working on something of our own choice that will help us grow as developers. We
spent part of a recent Friday going through the [React Tutorial] as a team.
Since we're all [Ember] developers, this lead to us making lots of comparisons.

## Getting Started

We're going to use [ember-cli] to set up our app. This won't provide us with a
local API server to run like like in the source files provided by the React
tutorial but we'll use another tool to handle that later on.

If you don't already have [ember-cli] installed, head over to [Installing
Ember][installing-ember].

To get started, we're going to use ember-cli to generate our new Ember app:

```javascript
ember new ember-comment-box
```

Now we can start the local ember app and view it in our browser at
[http://localhost:4200](localhost):

```bash
cd ember-comment-box
ember server
```

## Your First Component

> React is all about modular, composable components

Great! So is Ember.

To recap what the component structure that we're going to be building looks
like, it's this:

```no-highlight
- CommentBox
  - CommentList
    - Comment
  - CommentForm
```

The first version of our `CommentBox` component only needs to display some text.
Since there's no logic required yet, we only need to create a template:

```handlebars
// app/templates/components/comment-box.hbs

Hello, world! I am a comment-box.
```

Now we can use our new component inside our `application.hbs` template:

```handlebars
// app/templates/application.hbs

{{comment-box}}
```

--- compare JSX and Handlebars ---

## Composing Components

Let's build skeletons for `{{comment-list}}` and `{{comment-form}}` components:

```handlebars
// app/templates/components/comment-list.hbs

Hello, world! I am a CommentList.
```

```handlebars
// app/templates/components/comment-form.hbs

Hello, world! I am a CommentForm.
```

Now we can use these new components inside our `{{comment-box}}` component:

```handlebars
// app/templates/components/comment-box.hbs

<h1>Comments</h1>
{{comment-list}}
{{comment-form}}
```

### Using Props

- Task: Create a `{{comment-list-item}}` component
- Task: Pass data from parent component to child `{{comment-list-item}}`
  component

In React, data passed to a component is available inside the component via
`this.props`. Ember handles this a little bit differently, setting data passed
to a component as properties directly on the component.

In a template, we can access any properties that are available on the
component:

NOTES: update the {{comment-list-item}} template to match

--- add info about why we need to use {{comment-list-item}} vs {{comment}} ---

```handlebars
// app/components/templates/comment-list-item.hbs

<h2>{{author}}</h2>

{{yield}}
```

--- explain yield ---

Now that we have our `{{comment-list-item}}` component, we can use it to display
some comments on the page:

```handlebars
// app/templates/components/comment-list.hbs

{{#comment-list-item author="Yehuda Katz"}}
  This is one comment
{{/comment-list-item}}

{{#comment-list-item author="Tom Dale"}}
  This is *another* comment
{{/comment-list-item}}
```

--- explain block form of the component && yield ---

### Adding Markdown

Just like in the React tutorial, we're going to use a 3rd party library,
[ember-markdown-it][ember-markdown-it] to convert our Markdown text to HTML.

Install the ember-markdown-it ember addon:

```bash
ember install ember-markdown-it
```

We can update our `{{comment-list}}` component to convert our comment 
content from Markdown to HTML:

```handlebars
// app/templates/components/comment-list.hbs

{{#comment-list-item author="Yehuda Katz"}}
  {{markdown-render "This is one comment"}}
{{/comment-list-item}}

{{#comment-list-item author="Tom Dale"}}
  {{markdown-render "This is *another* comment"}}
{{/comment-list-item}}
```

--- explain the markdown render helper and SafeString ---

### Hook Up the Data Model

- Task: Render comments from a blob of JSON data instead of 

It's time to remove the hard coded comment data in our template and use a blob
of JSON as our data source. This data will eventually from from a server but
we'll get to that later.

Since we're using ember-cli, and not writing this app in a global context, we're
not going to be able to just create a global variable with our comment data.
Instead, we'll set the data as a property of this route's controller.

```javascript
// app/controllers/application.js

import Ember from 'ember';

const { Controller } = Ember;

export default Controller.extend({
  data: [
    { id: 1, author: 'Yehuda Katz', text: 'This is one comment' },
    { id: 2, author: 'Tom Dale', text: 'This is *another* comment' }
  ]
});
```

What's going on here isn't really relevant to this blog post, but here's a quick
rundown:

- We visit `/` (the default route for our app)
- The route sets up an `Ember.Controller` (the `ApplicationController` we just
  defined)
- The controller basically acts like a top-level component

Right now the hierarchy of our app looks like:

```
- ApplicationController (the one we just made)
  - CommentBox
    - CommentList
      - Comment
    - CommentForm
```

Now we want to make our `data` available to `{{comment-box}}`, so we can pass
the `data` property of our `ApplicationController` into the `{{comment-box}}`
component:

```handlebars
// app/templates/application.hbs

{{comment-box data=data}}
```

Now that our comment data is available as a property of our component, we can
use that in the `{{comment-box}}` template:

```handlebars
// app/templates/components/comment-box.hbs

<h1>Comments</h1>
{{comment-list data=data}}
{{comment-form}}
```

We pass the comment `data` from the context of our `{{comment-box}}`
component to its child `{{comment-list}}` component as another property, again called
`data`.

The final step here is to make `{{comment-list}}` dynamic by replacing our hard
coded comment data with the data being passed in as a property:

```handlebars
// app/templates/components/comment-list.hbs

{{#each data as |comment|}}
  {{#comment-list-item author=comment.author}}
    {{markdown-render comment.text}}
  {{/comment-list-item}}
{{/each}}
```

We use the `{{#each}}` helper here to iterate over each of the items in our
`data`. Inside the `{{#each}}` block we replace our hard coded strings with
references to properties of the `comment` that we're currently iterating over.

### Fetching from the server

It's time to replace all the hard coded data and begin fetching our data from a
server. The first step is to pass the URL that we want to fetch to our
`{{comment-box}}` component from its parent context:

```handlebars
// app/templates/application.hbs

{{comment-box url="/api/comments"}}
```

Note: The app won't be working at this point.

### Reactive state

So far, we've been using properties passed from the parent context in order to
render our components, each component being rendered once based on the
properties it has been given. Since we want our data to be fetched from the
server by our component, we're going to need to store some state.

Until now, we've only been working templates for our components. We need to jump
over to JavaScript now in order to define some custom behavior for our
component.

Let's create an array to hold the state of our comment data:

```javascript
// app/components/comment-box.js

import Ember from 'ember';

const { Component } = Ember;

export default Component.extend({
  init() {
    this._super(...arguments);

    this.data = [];
  }
});
```

This is the Ember equivalent of using `getInitialState` in React. Whenever an
instance of a component is created, its `init()` function will be called. We
need to call `this._super(...arguments)` when we override the function in order
to make sure that the component's usual initialization steps still take place.
Next we set the `data` property of our component to be an empty array.

#### Setting up our server

Like I mentioned earlier, we're not running the server provided by the React
tutorial. We're going to use the [ember-cli-mirage][todo] addon to set up a mock
server so we can simulate making network requests to a real server.

Install the addon:

```
$ ember install ember-cli-mirage
```

Note: Make sure to restart your ember server after installing the addon.

Replace the default Mirage config with the following:

```javascript
// app/mirage/config.js

export default function() {
  let comments = [
    { id: 1, author: 'Yehuda Katz', text: 'This is one comment' },
    { id: 2, author: 'Tom Dale', text: 'This is *another* comment' }
  ];

  this.get('/api/comments', () => {
    return comments;
  });

  this.post('/api/comments', (db, request) => {
    let comment = JSON.parse(request.requestBody);
    comments = comments.concat([comment]);
    return comments;
  });
}
```

#### Updating state

Now that we have our mock server set up, let's start fetching some data.

The first thing we're going to do is inject the [ember-ajax][todo] service
into our component. We could use the usual `$.ajax` but the ember-ajax addon is
included by default with ember-cli and provides a much nicer API.

```javascript
// app/components/comment-box.js

import Ember from 'ember';

const {
  Component,
  inject
} = Ember;

const { service } = inject;

export default Component.extend({
  ajax: service(),

  init() {
    this._super(...arguments);

    this.data = [];
  }
});
```

Now we can use the `ajax` service to fetch our comment data when a `CommentBox`
is created:

```javascript
// app/components/comment-box.js

import Ember from 'ember';

const {
  Component,
  get,
  inject,
  set
} = Ember;

const { service } = inject;

export default Component.extend({
  ajax: service(),

  init() {
    this._super(...arguments);

    this.data = [];

    get(this, 'ajax')
      .request(get(this, 'url'))
      .then((comments) => set(this, 'data', comments))
      .catch((error) => console.error(error));
  }
});
```

Here we use the `ajax` service to send a request to the URL we've passed in as
the `url` property of our component. When we receive a successful response, we
set a new value for our component's `data` property, which will cause our
component to rerender.

Let's implement live updates using simple polling:

```javascript
// app/components/comment-box.js

import Ember from 'ember';

const {
  Component,
  get,
  inject,
  set
} = Ember;

const { service } = inject;

export default Component.extend({
  ajax: service(),

  init() {
    this._super(...arguments);

    this.data = [];

    this.loadCommentsFromServer();

    setInterval(
      this.loadCommentsFromServer.bind(this),
      get(this, 'pollInterval')
    );
  },

  loadCommentsFromServer() {
    get(this, 'ajax')
      .request(get(this, 'url'))
      .then((comments) => set(this, 'data', comments))
      .catch((error) => console.error(error));
  }
});
```

```handlebars
// app/templates/application.hbs

{{comment-box url="/api/comments" pollInterval=2000}}
```

Open your browser's console and you should see the network requests being logged
by Mirage.

Until now, we've only defined out 

Now we want to update the `CommentBox` component so that when it receives the `url`
attribute, it sends a request to a server in order to fetch our comments data.
While you could use [Ember.$][ember-jquery] to send a regular ajax request

```javascript
