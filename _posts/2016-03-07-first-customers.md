Nothing validates the product you’ve been working so hard on quite like signing up your first customers, and it’s even better if you don’t have to wait until you launch it!

Getting sign ups before launch just makes good business sense. You begin with bona fide customers and don’t have downtime after launch, scrambling to get people onboard. Besides that, it takes those first few people to give you feedback for fine-tuning and encourage others to sign up by providing testimonials.

Undoubtedly, if your business is already known and you have a large audience to begin with, your launch task becomes a lot easier. But what if you’re unknown and building an audience completely from scratch?

Here are some ideas for finding your first customers before you launch, even as an unknown:

## Build An Audience

No business can successfully launch into a vacuum, so well before your product is ready to go (even if you don’t have a working prototype ready), you should start to build a following and generate buzz around your product.

### Set Up A Landing Page

You don’t even need to have your website set up to do this; create a landing page with the following basic elements on it:

* Your value proposition (for example from [Freshbooks](https://www.freshbooks.com/): “Small business accounting software designed for you, the non-accountant.”). A value proposition is usually able to be summed up in 10 words or less.
* Brief description of the product with some key features and benefits (if you’re not settled on features, think about what the key benefits will be and use those on your page).
* A sign up form for interested prospects.
* One or two high-quality images.

If you’re not building a page on your own website, you could try a service such as [Leadpages](http://www.leadpages.net/) or [Launchrock](https://www.launchrock.com/). The advantage to using these is that you don’t need to spend a lot of time and money building a website and can test out the validity of your idea first. If you don’t get very many sign ups on your page, perhaps your idea is either not worth building or requires some tweaking first.

### Drive Targeted Traffic To Your Landing Page

Paid advertising is definitely the quickest way to drive volumes of targeted traffic to your landing page when you’re still unknown. There are a few different avenues you can try, but Facebook advertising and Google AdWords are two of the most common.

Before choosing a method, think about who your target audience is and where they are likely to be hanging out online. It may be that more of them are on Pinterest or some other platform, so choose the place where you are more likely to encounter the right people.

For Google AdWords, you’re going to need to target keyword searches that you think your audience will be looking for. This may or may not be an economical option - if it’s a highly competitive set of keywords, each click will cost you more. The downside is that keywords still won’t give you the most targeted audience based on persona.

Facebook advertising gives you a few more options - you can really nail down demographics and interests of your audience. If you already have an email list of interested parties, you can also upload this and get Facebook to create a similar custom audience for you to target.

Besides paid options, make the most of every other platform for visibility that you have at your disposal. Thinking about the number of emails you probably send out every day, use the signature area for a bit of free advertising. Include a one-liner value proposition and links to your landing page and a relevant social media account.

Include a link to your landing page in your social profiles too, just don’t become that person who sends spammy messages to their friends. A casual post can be fairly inoffensive to them, however; try something like, “Hey guys, for anyone who’s interested, check out my new venture.”

### Make It Easily Shareable

Once people do sign up via your landing page, make sure you’ve made it easy for them to share. Include social share buttons on the “thank-you” page - a relatively small thing to do, but it certainly can make a difference if it brings in more sign-ups.

## Build Relationships

One of the biggest differences between a successful business and an unsuccessful one is the ability of the successful business to build good relationships. You need to be generating buzz and positive sentiment around your brand, as well as create an environment in which people want to help you.

There are many ways you could be seeking out and building business relationships, but here are a few that an absolute unknown can get out and do:

### Regular Contact With Your List

You’ve got some sign-ups on your list, now what? The answer is to keep in contact with them regularly, provide updates, items of interest, and generally help them to get to know you. If they hear nothing but silence from you for quite some time after signing up, there’s a good chance they could forget you entirely, and then your eventual email goes unopened.

If you’re stuck for ideas on what to say, think about things like surveys or brief polls (especially if they will provide you with helpful information), updates on your product, industry news, answers to FAQs, or best practice questions.

### Reward Referrers

Incentives can work to bring in new business if you use them the right way. Generally speaking, that means your incentive should be something that is relevant and will be appreciated by your customer.

For example, Dropbox offers extra storage space for free when its users refer others - an incentive which wouldn’t involve extra cost to Dropbox and will be valued by their users. Other ideas could be free upgrades or a discount applied to their fee.

### Your Content

Besides the SEO value that content can provide for your website, creating high-quality content is a great way to showcase your expertise and help build relationships by allowing people to get to know you.

If you want to get better coverage of your content, then you should look to methods of content amplification (and there are a lot of ways to do this - Social Media Examiner has [ten ways here](http://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/tools-amplify-content-reach/)). Rather than let posts sit on your website and hope they get discovered, here are a few extra steps to be taking:

* Send an email to your list when new content goes up.
* Syndicate on platforms such as LinkedIn and Medium.
* Get syndicated by a website such as [Business2Community](http://www.business2community.com/).
* Share all posts on your social media channels.
* Look for guest posting opportunities.
* Create supplemental content such as presentations for SlideShare.
* Answer relevant questions on Quora and include a link to your content.

There are many more ideas to amplify your content, the important thing is to find some ways that work for you and make sure you do it!

### Journalists And Bloggers

Who are the top 5-10 journalists or bloggers in your space? Follow them on social media, engage with them, comment on their articles and generally get to know them.

If you can, meet with them in person at events or by taking them out for coffee. It’s definitely better to get to know influential people before your launch if you want coverage from them, and it’s more likely to happen for people they know rather than being sent a cold email.

### Attend Events

Be seen and get known at events where your target customer can be found. Whether that’s attending trade shows, SXSW, conferences or even sponsoring a public event, you can’t stay behind your laptop screen if you want your business to be discovered and your launch to be successful.

## What About Getting Paying Customers?

The best validation of all is getting that first paying customer, so how do you go from having an interested list of prospects to having those first few paying customers pre-launch? One way that many SaaS have used is to incentivize them to sign up early.

For example, when [Brian Casal](http://casjam.com/your-first-customers/) was launching his previous business, Restaurant Engine, he got 60 sign-ups from his prospect list by announcing that anyone who signed up for the free Beta version would lock in a 20% discount off the paid plan.

Other businesses have brought in immediate cash by encouraging people to sign up early at a discount, while ensuring that they offer a money-back guarantee so that the prospect feels that signing up is not such a big risk. However you choose to do it, one of the secrets of successful launches has been getting paying customers early, rather than just a lot of people on free plans or sitting on a prospects list.

## Final Thoughts

If you’re launching a new app or software, the sooner you get to finding customers, even prior to launch, the better. Early sign-ups help you to validate your product and actually build an audience in order to gather feedback.

If you’re starting from scratch, you really need to work on building relationships quickly. This means staying in regular contact with your list, putting good content out through various channels, and engaging with people of influence in your space.

More importantly, get out and meet people. It’s difficult to build quality relationships if you stay behind a screen, so get to know people before you launch and you will have a ready audience.
