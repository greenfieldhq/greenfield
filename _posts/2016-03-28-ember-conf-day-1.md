89% of [Greenfield](www.greenfieldhq.com)'s team is attending [EmberConf 2016](http://emberconf.com/schedule.html).
With over 950+ attendees, this EmberConf's largest showing yet. It's an
exciting time to be working in Ember, and this short blog post highlights 
some of today's presentations:

###Keynote
This was a really great keynote by Yehuda Katz & Tom Dale highlight where Ember is headed, with a particular focus on performance & optimization.

- Ember core team remains but is also dividing up into sub-teams (Ember Data, Ember-CLI, Learning)
- Team is really pushing to be more mobile friendly
- Glimmer2 is phenomenally fast (seeing something in the range of 3-5x improvements in FPS)

###Service Workers
John Kleinschmidt of [cure.org](https://cure.org/) introduced us to Service Workers in Ember to highlight its benefits.

- Service workers as a reliable replacement for application cache
- Highlighted benefits of service workers for offline functionality in apps
- Impressed by how easily service workers can be integrated with Ember-CLi

###Cross-Pollinating Communities: We All Win
Chris Ball of [echobind](https://echobind.com/) presented a short history of Ember through multiple vantage points.

- "Good artists good copy, great artists steal"
- A great historical look at Ember.js from its roots in SproutCore to where we are today
- Ember has drawn from a number of frameworks (convention over configuration, one-way data binding) and other frameworks have drawn from Ember (Angularâ€™s CLI, React Router)

###<select>ing Good Ember Patterns

Brenna O'Brien spent time walking us through making good design pattern
choices in the vein of "Data Down, Actions Up" and Closure Actions to build
a flexible, reusable and modern app.

- Benefits of components with custom HTML & custom data flow
- Implementing DDAU to help add more dynamism to your Ember app
- `{{get}}` helper, which lets you [dynamically lookup](http://emberjs.com/api/classes/Ember.Templates.helpers.html#method_get) an object's property &`{{mut}}` helper to implement 1 or 2-way bindings
