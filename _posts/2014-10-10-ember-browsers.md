According to this [Stack Overflow post](http://stackoverflow.com/a/9874257/142873), Ember.js is tested against all
browsers listed on [BrowserStack](http://www.browserstack.com/list-of-browsers-and-platforms?product=live).

Summary from [Peter Wagenet](https://twitter.com/wagenet),

 >We have a couple test failures on some of the older platforms, but in practice they all do work. The biggest concern
 >if you support older versions of IE is performance. However, it should still work properly.
