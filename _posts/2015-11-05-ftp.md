A relic of the internet's Mesozoic era, File Transfer Protocol (FTP) remains in use across the business landscape. For years now, IT administrators and data security experts have been coming together around 3 main critiques of the protocol - to the tune of 40 million (!) results on Google for "[problems FTP](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&es_th=1&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=problems+ftp)".

What's finally changed? Put simply, where once there was only FTP, the explosion in the number of languages, protocols, and environments available to IT professionals and developers has created a plethora of options - from powerful off-the-shelf SaaS providers like [Thru](http://www.thruinc.com/) to bepsoke options produced in-house or by contractors - that has contributed to a critical mass. And for each business that moves away from FTP and achieves increased security, realizes improved usability, and enjoys lower costs, the decision to follow suit becomes simultaneously that much easier - "Our competitors have done it, **and are enjoying the benefits**." - and that much more urgent - "**Our competitors have done it**, and are enjoying the benefits".

Here are 3 reasons why it's time for your business to make the switch from FTP to a file management and transfer web service.

## FTP servers are expensive

[Maintaining your own servers is expensive](http://blog.greenfieldhq.com/2015/08/21/cloud-hosting/), period! Hardware alone is a significant line item, and that doesn't take into account the operating, maintenance, or associated staffing costs.

Adopting a self-hosted file exchange platform, whether an "off-the-shelf" option like [HostedFTP](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/hostedftp/) or a [custom solution](http://greenfieldhq.com/#contact), will save your business money in the long run.

## FTP is insecure

In fairness, when FTP was first designed and implemented - back in the 1970s! - it was basically [Matthew Broderick and Dabney Coleman](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086567/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1) arguing over the merits of the Queen's gambit while both were out-acted by an early-1980s mainframe computer. That is to say, the landscape of potential security threats was, like, Tatooine-level empty.

Since we're going to assume your company is without it's own quirky yet competent astromech droid, odds are then that you need to take data security more seriously. And yes, there are steps you can take to mitigate [FTP's inherent security gaps and flaws](http://www.southrivertech.com/five-ftp-server-security-fails-ftp-issues-and-how-to-avoid-them/). That list includes everything from straight-up unencrypted data to allowing anonymous access. It's hard to read through it and come away thinking FTP still is a viable choice for your business - especially so when alternative tools are available.

## FTP clients are hard to use

Compared to modern web services, FTP clients are a pain to install, configure, and use. Not only that, they also offer fewer security, auditing and monitoring capabilities. Many of the factors that made FTP the go-to file transfer option are [simply no longer relevant](https://mxforum.mendix.com/questions/4892/FTP-vs-Webservices).

Improved broadband connectivity - in terms of both speed and stability - and new concepts around what constitutes "secure" and efficient data transfer have made web services the easier, cheaper option. And although different web services will solve the problem in different ways, the benefits can be broken down into three main groups:

1. Security: Most modern FTP alternatives approach security in different ways but offer the same or a similar suite of features, including reporting, automation, auditability, encryption, and performance metrics. Gone are the days when it was OK to send usernames and passwords as plain text over FTP. And that's a good thing.

2. Auditing & Monitoring: Core to most web services is the ability to retain historic data. That can include not only access logs, but also file versions (incredibly useful in a collaborative environment) and meta data, all of which make it easier than ever for your IT support staff to quickly produce powerful audit trails.

3. Access: Some may implement [enterprise digital rights management](https://www.gartner.com/doc/3081017/role-enterprise-digital-rights-management), or information rights management; others may rely on [digital watermarking](http://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/answer/The-advantages-of-digital-watermarking-in-enterprise-data-protection); likely all will provide multi-dimensional access rights that allow your IT team to grant access at a granular (read: individual file, subdirectory, or directory; on-site or off-site access; temporary or permanent access, etc.) level.
