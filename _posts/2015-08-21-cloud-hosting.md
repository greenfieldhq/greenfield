Internal hosting solutions have served businesses' needs for decades. Powerfully
complex systems established to address specific needs, internal hosting is the
expensive, traditional way of doing business online. Cloud hosting is the
disruptor to this model, but that leaves unanswered the question of when should
_you_ move **your** business to the cloud.

One thing is certain - the cost of doing business according to tradition will
only increase. Based on data reported in a recent TekSystems market survey,
[IT budgets are expected to show continued growth](http://www.teksystems.com/resources/pressroom/2014/teksystems-annual-it-forecast-2015).
Digging into that data, however, reveals a troubling truth if your company is
still relying on internal hosting solutions:

> Heading into 2015, 45 percent of IT leaders expect their budgets to increase.
> This represents a 17 percent decline from the 2014 forecast, when 62 percent
> expected budgets to increase. _TekSystems_,

[IT 2015: Lower Expectations for
Budget Increases; Leaders Remain Optimistic in Ability to Support Business Objectives]([http://www.teksystems.com/resources/pressroom/2014/teksystems-annual-it-forecast-2015](http://www.teksystems.com/resources/pressroom/2014/teksystems-annual-it-forecast-2015)), December 2, 2014

This nugget, along with those same IT leaders' increased confidence in their
ability to satisfy their businesses' demands in the coming year, underscores the
impact of increased adoption of cloud hosting solutions. As more of your
competition realizes the benefits of transitioning away from legacy internal
hosting solutions, there is the very real danger that you are allowing inertia
to dictate how you handle your IT requirements. **Your business is being left
behind.**

Why is the world, including your competition, moving to the cloud? Four reasons.

## Cloud hosting will save you money
Maintaining internal hosting solutions - servers, and all of the support you're
required to keep in place around them, in the form of talent and resources - is
expensive; increasingly, prohibitively so. Cloud hosting means lower
infrastructure costs for your business on a month-to-month basis.

One estimate, made available via the industry resource HostReview, underscores
the massive inefficiency of internal hosting. If you're still relying on company
servers, the odds are you're leaving as much as
[40 percent (!) of your paid-for capacity idle](http://www.hostreview.com/blog/150316-cloud-hosting-vs-traditional-hosting-explained).

Of course, infrastructure is only part of your IT budget. The lion's share,
meanwhile, might be paid to your in-house talent. In fact, even as economic
models forecast broad salary stagnation,
[IT leaders expect salaries for data architects and similar talent to continue to rise](http://www.teksystems.com/resources/pressroom/2014/teksystems-annual-it-forecast-2015) as more businesses migrate to the cloud.

## Cloud hosting scales as you grow

If your reaction to the paragraph above is at all similar to our reaction when
we first read that data point, then the next question that came to your mind
likely is something along the lines of:

> _"If I'm paying a premium price for under-used infrastructure, how do I right-size my IT budget as I migrate to the cloud, and keep it right-sized as my business grows?"_

Cloud hosting providers such as [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/)
(AWS) make it easier than ever to "bake in" redundancy and scalability. With an
expert [cloud hosting service provider](http://greenfieldhq.com/#contact)
on hand to help you implement the correct
mix of features - everything from CloudFormation to Relational Database Service
to Elastic Load Balancer - right-sizing is dynamic, instant, and grounded in the
_needs of your business_.

## Cloud hosting gets you to market faster
A typical IT procurement cycle is lengthy. Spec'ing out an order for internal
servers goes beyond picking some hardware off a rack. There's also all the time
your IT professionals will spend ordering, installing and configuring hardware
and software - delays that keep you from going to market.

Cloud hosting services make it quick and easy to go from configuration to
activation. With the powerful and specialized tools available through providers
like AWS, the entire process can be completed in minutes instead of weeks.

## Cloud hosting is reliable
Saving money and improving the flexibility of your business are great. However,
the key concern for any hosting solution is reliability - will I or my customers
be able to access information on demand, with no interruptions?

Put simply, cloud hosting has it over internal hosting in spades. Using tools
available through AWS, Greenfield can ensure that your app or website
capitalizes on standard failover and backup practices and equipment. As compared
to the inherently fragile nature of internal hosting solutions - wherein **_your
server_** is your server, divorced from any larger entity - cloud hosting makes
redundancies and safeguards inherent to the environment. In other words,
reliability is a feature of the cloud.
