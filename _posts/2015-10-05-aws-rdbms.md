Relational databases are powerful tools, and key to extracting value from data. In effect storing your data as a series of related tables, a relational database management system, or **RDBMS**, allows you to view and query your data in novel and powerful ways. With managed RDBMS service providers such as [Amazon's RDS](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/), it's easier than ever for companies to leverage RDBMS systems.

Like when we wrote about the [benefits of AWS cloud hosting](http://blog.greenfieldhq.com/2015/08/21/cloud-hosting/) versus internal hosting options, Amazon's RDS service excels at removing the cost-, time-, and security-related hurdles of migrating your website and data to the cloud.

## How a RDBMS service provider saves you time

It's no secret - the surest path to reducing the time spent managing your database is automation. And Amazon's RDS service is the industry-standard solution when it comes to keeping your relational database running smoothly.

Amazon RDS accomplishes this by folding many of the most time-consuming tasks into its service offerings. Everything from keeping up with vendor security to applying performance patches is handled "behind the scenes" - leaving your team free to focus on achieving improvements elsewhere.

The ease of deploying RDS makes it a compelling option, provided it makes sense with your [business case](https://dzone.com/articles/10-tops-deciding-between). Especially for startups and scaleups that lack the resources needed for active database management, RDS will allow you to get up and running, and to scale, without bogging down your growing company in the minutiae of database administration.

## How a RDBMS provider saves you money

One way AWS truly differentiates itself from other cloud hosting providers is the ease with which it handles scalability. With [push-button compute scaling](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/details/#scalability), you can supercharge your database in minutes to respond to increased demand, **and pay for only the capacity that you actually use**.

Of course, performance is only axis along which you should evaluate an RDBMS provider. The other axis is storage. Part of the appeal of AWS, in general, is its pay-for-what-you-use billing model - rather than the upfront and substantial costs that come along with internal hosting solutions, you can add virtual machines and increase your computing power on the fly.

This same approach can be applied in scaling your storage solution. Whatever engine you use to speak to your data - Amazon Aurora, MySQL, Oracle, or [PostgreSQL](http://blog.greenfieldhq.com/2015/02/14/migrate-your-rails-database-from-mysql-to-postgresql) - a [skilled database administrator](http://greenfieldhq.com/#contact) will be able to help you provision additional storage, as needed and on the fly. Think about that - growth, with zero downtime and no ceiling.

## How a RDBMS provider protects your data

![RDS data security]({{ BASE_PATH }}/assets/images/aws-rdbms/data-security.png)

Cloud computing has the potential to be the most secure means available of managing and transmitting your data. Whether you're processing payments for your eCommerce site or storing sensitive information for your clients, data security is and must be a primary concern in any hosting decision.

Fortunately, tools like [AWS Key Management Service](https://aws.amazon.com/kms/), [SSL certificates](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html), and [AWS Identity and Access Management](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/) make it possible to protect your users' data from start to finish, including in transmission.

* AWS Key Management Service (KMS) - Integrated with the suite of AWS services, including Amazon RDS, KMS gives you a single dashboard from which you can create, define, and manage the encryption of your data.

* SSL certificates - If your database instance is running on any of the [MySQL](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_MySQL.html#MySQL.Concepts.SSLSupport), [SQL Server](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_SQLServer.html#SQLServer.Concepts.General.SSL), or [PostgreSQL](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_PostgreSQL.html#PostgreSQL.Concepts.General.SSL) engines, Amazon's RDS lets you use SSL to encrypt the connection to your database.

* AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) - If your database must remain accessible to a large team, IAM affords you with ample means of controlling access, including allowing or restricting access based on time of day (so you can restrict access, for instance, outside of normal work hours), a user's IP address (so that your database only can be accessed on-site, or from trusted connections), or to allow or deny access according to user groups you define.

RDS also includes robust [backup and recovery](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/details/#ha) services. By default upon installation, Amazon RDS backs up your database and access logs, allowing you to restore your database to its historic status of any given second within its retention period. Even better, you (or your database administrator) can define the retention period to last as long as makes sense for your business needs, up to 35 days.

You might be asking yourself, "What if that 35-day window isn't long enough?" We've got you covered. Amazon RDS allows you to create database snapshots - static images of your database you create on demand - and store them on your Amazon S3 indefinitely. (And if you're worried about data usage and associated charges - don't be. Database snapshots function as full backups but the costs incurred are only for your incremental storage used.
